            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol class="info">
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
                </ol>
